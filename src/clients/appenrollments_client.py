    types of apps include connectors and feature enhancement apps. The

    configuration, and settings.

    while leaving other values alone. As input you should supply a list 
    of field names and new values. For example, you can provide the 
    field name "IsActive" and specify the new value "False"; this API 
    will then change the value of IsActive to false.
