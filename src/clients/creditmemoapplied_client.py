    Retrieves the Credit Memo Application specified by this unique

    to Invoices as Payments. When a Credit Memo is applied as payment to 
    an Invoice, Lockstep creates a Credit Memo Application record to

    the Invoice. You can examine Credit Memo Application records to 
    track which Invoices were paid using this Credit.
