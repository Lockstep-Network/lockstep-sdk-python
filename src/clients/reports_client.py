    The Aging Report contains information about the total dollar value 
    of invoices broken down by their age. Last default or specified 
    bucket treated as a catch all bucket for values that fit in that 
    bucket or beyond. 

    You can specify viewing parameters for the aging report such as 
    currency code and date bucket configuration. You can also view aging 
    data for an entire account or a specific company. 

    This information is recalculated when invoice data changes. After 
    each invoice data change occurs, Lockstep queues up a calculation 
    based on the current invoice data at that time. This information is 
    calculated and persisted for each customer so that the report will 
    be available quickly. 

    To force a recalculation of aging data, specify the `recalculate` 
    option. Note that forcing a recalculation will slow your API 
    response time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    CompanyId : str
        Company aging buckets are filtered by (all company aging 
        returned if not company specified)
    Recalculate : bool
        Force api to recalculate aging data, cached data may be returned 
        when set to false
    CurrencyCode : str
        Currency aging buckets are converted to (all aging data returned 
        without currency conversion if no currency is specified)
    CurrencyProvider : str
        Currency provider currency rates should be returned from to 
        convert aging amounts to (default Lockstep currency provider 
        used if no data provider specified)
    Buckets : list[int]
        Customized buckets used for aging calculations (default buckets 
        [0,30,60,90,120,180] will be used if buckets not specified)
