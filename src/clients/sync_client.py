    Requests a new Sync task from the Application specified in the 
    request and returns a token that can be used to check the progress

    particular account. An Application can provide many different tasks

    background and will continue running after they are created. Use one 
    of the creation APIs to request execution of a task. To check on the 
    progress of the task, call GetSync or QuerySync.

    Updates an existing Sync with the information supplied to this PATCH 
    call. 

    This API is restricted to internal service users and may not be 
    called by customers or partners. 

    The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the object 
    while leaving other values alone. As input you should supply a list 
    of field names and new values. For example, you can provide the 
    field name "IsActive" and specify the new value "False"; this API 
    will then change the value of IsActive to false.
