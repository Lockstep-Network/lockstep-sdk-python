    Retrieves the Custom Field Definition specified by this unique 
    identifier. 

    A Custom Field represents metadata added to an object within the 
    Lockstep Platform. Lockstep provides a core definition for each 
    object. The core definition is intended to represent a level of 
    compatibility that provides support across most accounting systems 
    and products. When a user or developer requires information beyond 
    this core definition, you can use Custom Fields to represent this 
    information. See 
    [Extensibility](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/extensibility) 
    for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str
        The unique Lockstep Platform ID number of this Custom Field 
        Definition
    include : str
        To fetch additional data on this object, specify the list of 
        elements to retrieve. No additional data collections are 
        currently defined on this object, but may be supported in the 
        future.

    """
    Updates an existing Custom Field Definition with the information 
    supplied to this PATCH call. 

    The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the object 
    while leaving other values alone. As input you should supply a list 
    of field names and new values. If you do not provide the name of a 
    field, that field will remain unchanged. This allows you to ensure 
    that you are only updating the specific fields desired.

    ----------
    id : str
        The unique Lockstep Platform ID number of the Custom Field 
        Definition to update
