    Retrieves the Invoice specified by this unique identifier, 
    optionally including nested data sets. 

    An Invoice represents a bill sent from one company to another. The 
    creator of the invoice is identified by the `CompanyId` field, and 
    the recipient of the invoice is identified by the `CustomerId` 
    field. Most invoices are uniquely identified both by a Lockstep 
    Platform ID number and a customer ERP "key" that was generated by 
    the system that originated the invoice. Invoices have a total amount 
    and a due date, and when some payments have been made on the Invoice 
    the `TotalAmount` and the `OutstandingBalanceAmount` may be 
    different.

    ----------
    id : str
        The unique Lockstep Platform ID number of this invoice; NOT the 
        customer's ERP key

    """
    Updates an existing Invoice with the information supplied to this 
    PATCH call. 

    The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the object 
    while leaving other values alone. As input you should supply a list 
    of field names and new values. If you do not provide the name of a 
    field, that field will remain unchanged. This allows you to ensure 
    that you are only updating the specific fields desired. An Invoice 
    represents a bill sent from one company to another. The creator of 
    the invoice is identified by the `CompanyId` field, and the 
    recipient of the invoice is identified by the `CustomerId` field.
