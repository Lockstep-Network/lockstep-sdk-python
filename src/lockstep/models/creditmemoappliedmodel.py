    Credit Memos reflect credits granted to a customer for various
    reasons, such as discounts or refunds. Credit Memos may be applied
    to Invoices as Payments. When a Credit Memo is applied as payment to
    an Invoice, Lockstep creates a Credit Memo Application record to
    track the amount from the Credit Memo that was applied as payment to
    the Invoice. You can examine Credit Memo Application records to
    track which Invoices were paid using this Credit.
