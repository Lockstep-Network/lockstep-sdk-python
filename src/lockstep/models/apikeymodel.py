    An API Key is an authentication token that you may use with the
    Lockstep API. Because API Keys do not have an expiration date, they
    are well suited for unattended processes. Each API Key is associated
    with a user, and may be revoked to prevent it from accessing the
    Lockstep API. When you create an API Key, make sure to save the
    value in a secure location. Lockstep cannot retrieve an API Key once
    it is created. For more information, see [API
    Keys](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/api-keys).
