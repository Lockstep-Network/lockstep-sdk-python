A note is a customizable text string that can be attached to various 
account attributes within Lockstep. You can use notes for internal 
communication, correspondence with clients, or personal reminders. The 
Note Model represents a note and a number of different metadata 
attributes related to the creation, storage, and ownership of the note. 
See [Extensibility](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/extensibility) 
for more information.
