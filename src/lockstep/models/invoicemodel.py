class InvoiceModel:
    """
    An Invoice represents a bill sent from one company to another. The
    creator of the invoice is identified by the `CompanyId` field, and
    the recipient of the invoice is identified by the `CustomerId`
    field. Most invoices are uniquely identified both by a Lockstep
    Platform ID number and a customer ERP "key" that was generated by
    the system that originated the invoice. Invoices have a total amount
    and a due date, and when some payments have been made on the Invoice
    the `TotalAmount` and the `OutstandingBalanceAmount` may be
    different.
