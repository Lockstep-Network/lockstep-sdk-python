    An AppEnrollment represents an app that has been enrolled to the

    types of apps include connectors and feature enhancement apps. The
    App Enrollment object contains information about this app, its
    configuration, and settings. See [Applications and
    Enrollments](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/applications-and-enrollments)
