class SyncRequestModel:
    """
    Represents a Sync action that loads data from a connector into the
    Lockstep Platform. Users can request Sync actions manually using
    Lockstep Inbox, or via the [Create Sync
    API](https://developer.lockstep.io/reference/post_api-v1-sync). Each
    Sync action is tied to an [AppEnrollment](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/applications-and-enrollments).
    When the Sync action is complete, the field `StatusCode` will be set
    to either `Success` or `Failed`. You can fetch a list of detailed
    results for the Sync API by calling Retrieve or Query with an
    `include` parameter of `details`. These detailed results contain
    line-by-line errors that were detected during processing of this
    sync.
