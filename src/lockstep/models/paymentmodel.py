class PaymentModel:
    """
    A Payment represents money sent from one company to another. A
    single payment may contain payments for one or more invoices; it is
    also possible for payments to be made in advance of an invoice, for
    example, as a deposit. The creator of the Payment is identified by
    the `CustomerId` field, and the recipient of the Payment is
    identified by the `CompanyId` field. Most Payments are uniquely
    identified both by a Lockstep Platform ID number and a customer ERP
    "key" that was generated by the system that originated the Payment.
    Payments that have not been fully applied have a nonzero
    `UnappliedAmount` value, which represents a deposit that has been
    paid and not yet applied to an Invoice.
