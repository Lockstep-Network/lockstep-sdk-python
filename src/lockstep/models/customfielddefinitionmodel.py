    A Custom Field represents metadata added to an object within the
    Lockstep Platform. Lockstep provides a core definition for each
    object. The core definition is intended to represent a level of
    compatibility that provides support across most accounting systems
    and products. When a user or developer requires information beyond
    this core definition, you can use Custom Fields to represent this
    information. See [Extensibility](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/extensibility)
