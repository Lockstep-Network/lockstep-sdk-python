    A Contact contains information about a person or role within a
    Company. You can use Contacts to track information about who is
    responsible for a specific project, who handles invoices, or
    information about which role at a particular customer or vendor you
    should speak with about invoices. An Accounting Profile Contact has
    a link to a Contact that is associated with your company's
    Accounting Profile. These Contacts are secondary contacts to the
